<!-- lifecycle: one-shot -->

## BOT

- [ ] Check if `.flowdeck/.farmdeck/` exists. If not, stop and note under `## HUMAN` to run `farmdeck-init` first.

- [ ] Read `## HUMAN` below for slug, name, email, company, role, source, and notes. Slug and name are required — stop and surface any missing required values under `## HUMAN`.

- [ ] Check if `.flowdeck/.farmdeck/prospects/{{SLUG}}/` already exists. If it does, stop and note under `## HUMAN` that this slug is taken.

- [ ] Create `.flowdeck/.farmdeck/prospects/{{SLUG}}/`.

- [ ] Write `PROSPECT.md` from `_energy-cards/PROSPECT.md.template` — substitute all fields. Set `Stage` to `Seed` and `Added` to today's date.

- [ ] Write `INTERACTIONS.md` from `_energy-cards/INTERACTIONS.md.template` — leave the log empty.

- [ ] Scaffold `TODO.md`:
  ```markdown
  # {{NAME}}

  {{COMPANY}} · {{ROLE}} · {{EMAIL}}
