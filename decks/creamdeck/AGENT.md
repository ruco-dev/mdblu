# creamdeck

The `.flowdeck/.creamdeck/` directory is a minimal, project-scoped CRM deck. It tracks contacts and incoming communications (emails, calls) relevant to this project.

**Standing cards (created by `creamdeck-init`):**
- `.flowdeck/.creamdeck/creamdeck-inbox/` — `TODO.md` — all incoming items (emails routed from emaildeck, logged calls); each item is a subfolder with `INBOX-ITEM.md` + `TODO.md`

**Per-instance cards:**
- `.flowdeck/.creamdeck/contacts/<slug>/` — `CONTACT.md` + `TODO.md` — one per tracked contact; created from an inbox item or directly via `creamdeck-add-contact`
- `.flowdeck/.creamdeck/tickets/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>/` — `TICKET.md` + `TODO.md` — one per ticket; opened via `creamdeck-open-ticket` or the `open-ticket` action in `tickets/TODO.md`

**Inbox item lifecycle:**
1. Item arrives (emaildeck routes a thread, or you log a call via `create-inbox-item`)
2. Inbox management card is played — bot surfaces unrouted items
3. Per-item `TODO.md` is played — bot summarises and activates ACTIONS
4. Human picks an action: `create-contact`, `log-to-contact`, `draft-reply`, `route-to-crunchdeck`, `schedule-follow-up`, or `archive`

**Ticket lifecycle:**
1. Ticket is opened via `creamdeck-open-ticket` — stage defaults to New
2. Ticket card is played — bot surfaces summary and flags stale Waiting tickets
3. Human advances stage, logs updates, drafts replies, or closes the ticket
4. Stage sequence: New → Open → Waiting → Resolved → Closed

**emaildeck integration:** configure an emaildeck filter with `send-to-creamdeck` in its default tasks to route matched threads automatically into `.creamdeck/creamdeck-inbox/`.

**crunchdeck integration:** any inbox item can be forwarded to `.crunchdeck/crunchdeck-inbox/` via the `route-to-crunchdeck` action, turning a contact signal into a product signal.

**Blueprints:**
- `creamdeck-init` — scaffold `.flowdeck/.creamdeck/` in this project
- `creamdeck-add-contact` — create a new contact card directly (without going through inbox)
- `creamdeck-open-ticket` — open a new ticket card
